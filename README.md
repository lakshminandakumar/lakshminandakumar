### :woman_technologist: About Me :

I am a Senior QA Engineer/SDET with over 14 years of industry experience.

- :zap: When I'm not working you'll find me engrossed in a book. I'm a typical bookworm & a voracious reader. I write technical blogs too. I practice yoga & meditation to connect my mind with my body & find peace. I also like to spend time in the nature, therefore enjoy bike riding, hiking & going on long walks.
